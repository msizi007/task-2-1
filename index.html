            <h3>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1926.431</h3>
            <div class="card m-4">

                    <p>
                        This standard relates to equipment upkeep and maintenance. If employers don't 
                        inspect, repair, and upgrade their machinery, that can lead to failure and electrical 
                        injury or death. This specific standard refers to the construction industry, but the 
                        recommendations work well for all job sites. Some elements of standard 1926.431 
                        include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Explosion-Proofing-</b> Employers must maintain equipment so that there is 
                                little to no risk of an explosion due to electrical malfunction. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Dust Proofing-</b> Dust can get into machinery and cause various problems, 
                                both mechanical and electrical. Employers must protect all gear from 
                                dust-related incidents that could lead to an explosion or electrical arc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>General Maintenance and Upkeep-</b> Employers and employees must 
                                monitor equipment and machinery to watch out for loose screws, gaskets, 
                                and other pieces that may interfere with dust and explosion prevention. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Reporting and Repair-</b> If a worker spots any issues with machinery, they 
                                have to report to a supervisor immediately. Once a report is filed, the 
                                employer must stop using the circuit until the problem is fixed. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

        <p>
            In the event of an accident involving electricity, if the individual is down or 
            unconscious, or not breathing: CALL 911 immediately. If an individual must be 
            physically removed from an electrical source, it is always best to eliminate the 
            power source first (i.e., switch off the circuit breaker). However, if time or 
            circumstance do not allow this option, be sure to use a nonconductive item such as 
            50 | Page 
            a dry board. Failure to think and react properly could make you an additional 
            victim. If the individual is not breathing and you have been trained in CPR, have 
            someone call 911 and begin CPR IMMEDIATELY!
